            <td class="schedule-description">Many important application domains generate distributed collections of  heterogeneous local datasets. These local datasets are related via an intrinsic network  structure that arises from domain-specific notions of similarity between local datasets.  Networked federated learning combines information in local data and their network  structure to learn accurate personalized models in a distributed fashion.  We formulate  networked federated learning as an instance of regularized empirical risk minimization  using generalized total variation (GTV) as a regularizer. This formulation unifies and considerably extends recent approaches to federated learning. We develop a duality between GTV minimization and network flow optimization. This duality proves useful both computationally and conceptually. The network flow picture lends naturally to precise conditions on the network structure and local models such that network optimization algorithms are successful. </td>

            UAV swarm enabled communications: System Design for Spectrum and Energy Efficiency with Security Considerations

          Multi-UAV deployments create new opportunities for wireless communications. By coordinating the UAVs, they can act as a virtual-antenna-array and use multi antenna communication schemes like distributed MIMO and distributed beamforming (BF). 

Distributed MIMO enables a swarm of UAVs to transmit multiple data streams simultaneously to a multiantenna ground station (GS), thus improving the spectral efficiency. Due to the line-of-sight propagation between the swarm and the GS, the MIMO channel is highly correlated, leading to limited multiplexing gains. By optimizing the UAV positions, the swarm can attain the maximum capacity given by the single-user-bound. To achieve this capacity, we propose a centralized approach using block coordinate descent and distributed iterative approach using linear controllers. 

Distributed BF can extend the communication range of a remotely deployed swarm, avoiding energy waste in travel towards the destination radio. In order to beamform, the UAVs typically rely on the destination feedback, however, noisy feedback degrades the BF gains. To limit the degradation, we developed an analytical framework to predict the BF gains at a given SNR and used it to optimize the signaling with the destination. The proposed framework was verified experimentally in the lab and using UAV-mounted software-defined-radios (SDR). We also developed a feedback-free BF approach that eliminates the need for destination feedback entirely in a LOS channel. In this approach, one BF radio acts as a guide and moves to point the beam of the remaining radios towards the destination. This approach tolerates localization error and was demonstrated using SDRs.

As for the security considerations, they apply beyond UAVs to any wireless device. Security considerations include radio authentication and interpreting unauthorized signals. For device authentication, we leveraged the radios' RF fingerprint extracted using deep learning and formulated an open set classification problem to reject signals from unauthorized transmitters. We compared several approaches   and studied the training dataset impact on performance. To blindly decode unauthorized signals, we proposed the dual path network (DPN) combining digital signal processing and deep learning for modulation classification and blind symbol decoding. DPN design yields interpretable outputs and by jointly estimating the unknown parameters, it improves the modulation classification accuracy.        </td>

            </td>
            <td class="schedule-description">Rapid increases in the availability of data and computational resources have led to a paradigm shift in many areas of engineering and beyond. While in the past, the design and operation of engineering systems have been based on carefully crafted (physical) models, an abundance of data and processing capabilities has allowed them to be replaced by data-driven solutions, where the modelling step itself is delegated to the machine. Such underdetermined learning tasks frequently give rise to highly non-convex optimisation problems. Such problems can be NP-hard in the worst case, yet the practical success of gradient-based algorithms in many applications (such as back-propagation for deep learning) suggest that an important subset of non-convex optimisation problems can be solved both efficiently and reliably. Analytical guarantees of this kind have appeared only recently.
 
          At the same time, the democratisation of technology has caused both data and computational resources to be accessible at dispersed and heterogeneous locations, rather than powerful centralised processing centers. Data is generated and processed on our mobile devices, in sensors scattered throughout “smart cities” and “smart grids”, and vehicles on the road. Central aggregation of raw data is frequently neither efficient nor feasible, due to concerns around communication constraints, privacy, and robustness to link and node failure. The purpose of decentralised optimisation and learning is then to devise intelligent, data-driven, engineering systems by means of decentralised processing and peer-to-peer interactions, while preserving the strong performance guarantees of centralised architectures and yet ensuring communication efficiency, privacy and robustness. This talk will review recent results on the development and analysis of learning algorithms over networks and the associated performance trade-offs. </td>
